# Projects from CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native course at Harvard University
> This repository has a goal to make public all the projects developed on CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native course.

This is an online course offered by Harvard University via edx.org. During the course, several projects are proposed to train the knowledge learned and I thought interesting to share these projects with all.

## Proposed projects

### Project 0 

The goal of this project is to practice JavaScript and its paradigms by creating
a TODO app. This app should be able to add TODOs and track the number of total
TODOs as well as the number of unchecked TODOs.

### Project 1 

For this project, you'll be implementing a Pomodoro timer. This timer will help
people trying to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
It will vibrate to tell you when to take breaks or resume working, based on some
determined values. Check out the [staff solution](#staff-solution) for a working
version.

### Project 2 
*pending*

For this project, you'll be implementing a movie browser. It will allow users to
search for movies included in the [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
and view additional information about any movies they select. Check out the
[staff solution](#staff-solution) for a working version.

### Final project
*pending*
- Implement a project with JavaScript and React Native from scratch.
- Develop a workflow for developing mobile apps.
- Design your own interfaces.
