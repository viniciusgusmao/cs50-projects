# Projects from CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native course at Harvard University
This repository has a goal to make public all the projects developed on CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native course.

This is an online course offered by Harvard University via edx.org. During the course, several projects are proposed to train the knowledge learned and I thought interesting to share my projects with all.
